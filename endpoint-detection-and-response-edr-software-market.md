<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Endpoint Detection And Response (EDR) Software Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>On-Premise</li><li>Cloud-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) software can be categorized into two primary market types: on-premise and cloud-based solutions. On-premise EDR deploys software directly on a company's local servers, allowing for enhanced control over data and security but requiring more maintenance and resources. In contrast, cloud-based EDR solutions offer flexibility and scalability, allowing organizations to access advanced threat detection and response capabilities through the internet, often with lower upfront costs and less IT burden. Both types aim to enhance endpoint security.</p></p>
