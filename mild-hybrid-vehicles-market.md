<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mild-Hybrid Vehicles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SHEV</li><li>PHEV</li><li>PSHEV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mild-hybrid vehicles encompass three market types: SHEV, PHEV, and PSHEV. SHEV (simple hybrid electric vehicle) utilizes a small electric motor to assist a gasoline engine, improving efficiency without full electric capability. PHEV (plug-in hybrid electric vehicle) allows external charging, enabling longer electric-only driving ranges while still relying on a gasoline engine. PSHEV (plug-in series hybrid electric vehicle) operates primarily on electric power but can switch to a gasoline engine for extended range. Each type serves unique consumer needs and enhances fuel efficiency.</p></p>
