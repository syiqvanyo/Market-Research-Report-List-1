<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pervious Pavement Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pervious Concrete</li><li>Porous Asphalt</li><li>Interlocking Concrete Pavers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pervious pavement market comprises three primary types: pervious concrete, porous asphalt, and interlocking concrete pavers. Pervious concrete features a high void content, allowing water to flow through while supporting heavy loads. Porous asphalt consists of asphalt mixtures that enable water infiltration, enhancing stormwater management. Interlocking concrete pavers are designed with gaps that permit water drainage between stones, promoting surface permeability. Collectively, these materials contribute to sustainable urban infrastructure by managing stormwater runoff and reducing surface flooding.</p></p>
